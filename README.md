# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
In this challenge we have to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. 
In this project, you’ll have access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. You’ll need to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, you’ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, you’ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
Using knowledge of the cloud ETL process, I have created an AWS RDS database named ‘AWS’ with tables in pgAdmin.
Then chose a dataset from the Amazon Review datasets (Links to an external site.), and extracted the dataset into a DataFrame. We transformed the DataFrame into four separate DataFrames that match the table schema in pgAdmin. Then, uploaded the transformed data into the customer_table,products_table,review_id_table,vine_table and run queries in pgAdmin to confirm that the data has been uploaded
